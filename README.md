# Data-augmentation-using-the-MNIST-dataset
Data augmentation with the MNIST dataset involves applying techniques like rotation, translation, scaling, and noise addition to diversify training data, enhancing machine learning model robustness for tasks such as digit recognition. These methods help the model better handle real-world variations and challenges in handwritten digit recognition.
